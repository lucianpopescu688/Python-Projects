   6. Undo/redo:
     
     - undo the last operation that modified the array;
     - redo the last operation that modified the array;

The application is divided into several files/folders:

- Main_functions folder contains the file with the above and some additional ones;
- Main_menu folder contains the file that runs the aplication and the tests;
- Tests folder contains the tests for the above features;
- User_inteface folder contains the console type interface;
